            Hello! My name is Syed Muhammad Huzaifa Alam. I prefer to go by Huzaifa. My pronouns are He/Him. I began my journey in the field of Computer Science in the fall of 2023 when I came to study at the University of Arizona. I am deeply fascinated by how technology shapes our world and love building software that solves real problems or makes the world an exciting place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through my academic journey and personal projects, I've gained experience with multiple programming languages and modern frameworks. I am eager to learn new tools and techniques. This portfolio serves as my journal to document my journey through the tech world/industry I want to be part of. Beyond coding, I enjoy collaborating with others and sharing knowledge to build better solutions together.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am not programming, you can find me exploring new tech trends, playing soccer with friends, or listening to music.
          </p>
